# Vulnerability Scan Lab in Azure

## Introduction
This repository documents my experience conducting a vulnerability scan using OpenVAS in an Azure environment. The purpose of this lab was to assess the security posture of a Server 2022 instance with various configurations.

## Lab Setup
- **Environment**: Azure Cloud
- **Target Machine**: Server 2022, IP 10.10.1.22
- **Scanning Tool**: OpenVAS on Parrot OS

## Process Overview
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Created a Server 2022 VM in Azure.
   - Pre-configured the VM with no updates and firewall turned off for initial scanning.

2. **Scanning with OpenVAS**:
   - Logged into Parrot OS VM in Azure.
   - Conducted an initial quick scan using OpenVAS on the target Server 2022 VM.

3. **Findings and Analysis**:
   - [Detail your findings here, what vulnerabilities were found, their potential impact, etc.]

4. **Modifying Configurations and Re-scanning**:
   - Turned the firewall back on the Server 2022 VM.
   - Conducted a second scan to assess changes in the vulnerability landscape.

5. **Comparison and Conclusions**:
   - [Discuss any changes in the scan results after the firewall was enabled and any other observations.]

## Reflections
In this lab, I gained hands-on experience in several key areas of cybersecurity and system administration, including:

- **Virtual Machine Configuration**:
  - Successfully set up and configured a Parrot OS virtual machine and a Server 2022 VM in the Azure environment.
  - Learned the nuances of VM management in a cloud setting, dealing with network configurations, and resource allocation.

- **Vulnerability Scanning with OpenVAS**:
  - Explored the functionalities of OpenVAS, an open-source tool, for conducting comprehensive vulnerability scans.
  - Understood the process of scanning a networked system, analyzing the scan results, and identifying potential security vulnerabilities.

- **Practical Application of Security Concepts**:
  - Applied theoretical knowledge of network security in a practical setting, enhancing my understanding of real-world cybersecurity challenges.
  - Developed a deeper appreciation for the importance of regular security assessments in maintaining a strong security posture.
